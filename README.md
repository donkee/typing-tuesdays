# Typing Tuesdays

This app was created to help my daughter learn how to use a computer. It contains fun exercises around finding keys on the keyboard, clicking the mouse, and clicking and dragging the mouse. It is also designed to help children with their color, shape, and object recognition skills.

It uses the [Speechsynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) for text-to-speech and [Konva](https://konvajs.org/) for drawing things to the page.
